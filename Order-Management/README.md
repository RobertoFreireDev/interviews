### Notes:

1 - Race conditions:
 
1.1 - At database level

Example: Reserve/Lock Inventory.

- It should be an atomic operation at database level to avoid race conditions between multiple users in the same or on different application instances on the server/cloud.

1.2 - At application level

Example: Distributed Lock.

- If two or more consumers read the same event simultaneously and a call is made to an external API—such as a Payment Gateway—that does not support database transactions, a Distributed Lock should be implemented. Using a tool like Redis (which is faster than a traditional database) ensures that multiple instances of a consumer do not attempt to process the same event at the exact same time.

2 - Transactional outbox pattern

- All the events sent should follow this pattern.
- Example: Save both order details and order created (outbox message) to the same database in a single transaction. A separate and decoupled process reads from the outbox table and publishes to a message broker and then it deletes the current outbox message. There is a very small chance that after a event being publish, for some reason (application is down, for example), the outbox message was not deleted. Thus, a duplicated order created event will be sent to message bus. To avoid this, we must implement Idempotency on the consumer side.

3 - Idempotency on the consumer side

- One solution is to store the fact that event has been processed. So, next time, if the same event is triggered, the consumer will acknowledge it but not process. The consumer will silently ignore it. You will need a idempotency key (either hash the event payload or use the orderid) and store it in the database. Remember that the ProcessedEvents table will grow indefinitely. Implement a TTL (Time-to-Live) or a background job to delete records older than X number of days.
- Another solution is to design the consumer-side operation itself to be idempotent, if possible. This ensures that duplicate events result in the same final state. Example: UPDATE Orders SET Status = 'Processed' WHERE OrderId = 123 AND Status = 'Pending'.

4 - Synchronous/Async payment methods:

- Direct authorization via http request
- Authorize payment request via webhook or polling.
