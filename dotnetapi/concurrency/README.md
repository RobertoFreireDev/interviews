## Testing Concurrency Issue

Run scripts from topics\Script.sql

Run ConcurrencyDemoConsoleApp

SELECT * FROM items;

SELECT * FROM item_updates_log;

### General concurrency issue

All concurrent requests are completed but using the initial value, leading to wrong calculation if the update depends on previous value

Example: Two requests read value=10 at the same time, both add 1, and write back 11. The correct final value should be 12 instead of 11.

### Optimistic concurrency control

Only the first concurrent request is completed. All the other requests fail (or retry, depending on your logic) if the version has changed.

### Pessimistic concurrency control

All concurrent requests are completed because the database locks each request. No lost updates, but requests may be delayed due to waiting for the lock.
